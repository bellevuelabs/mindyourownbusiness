        <h1> We're In Business!! </h1>
        <h1> Group Party Game! </h1>
        <p> After graduating top of your MBA honors class, you are now a master business administrator (MBA)! </p>
        <p> As you perfect the Goldman Sachs Elevator pitch to climb the corporate ladder to the glass ceiling with your Major Business Aptitude, </p>
        <p> Remember the key Modus Operandi:  </p>
        <p> MBA!!! </p>
        <p> The acronym: </p>
        <p> Money, Banking, and Assets!! </p>
        <p> Monumental Bragging Ambitions!! </p> 
        <p> Who cares if you cure cancer, eliminate natural disasters, stop global warming, </p>
        <p> solve world hunger, end all war (or start wars), or send astronauts and gamestonk cryptocurrencies to the moon... </p>
        <p> It only matters if YOU CAN SELL IT! (while increasing shareholder value) </p>
        <p> Your business ventures adventures begin right now as you attend our annual global innovation convention's startup founders incubator gala, held in "DC," the fed's Capital Debt city. </p>
        <p> This is a perfect opportunity to participate in our collegiate colleague cocktail mixers buffet to network with like-minded eloquent entrepeneurs, </p>
        <p> who also aspire to go mind their own business, completely from scratch! </p>
        <p> Maybe they'll even sell you some diversified equity included in the MBA (Market Bargaining Agreement) clause </p>
        <p> so you don't have to follow the hoi polloi herd of sheepple just going along with the whims of the infamous "500 Stupid Pundits" (S&P500). </p>
        <p> ******* </p>
        <p> ******* </p>
        <p> After brainstorming, while you mind your own cutting-edge business from the very ground up, </p>
        <p> From your MBA studies, remember the core components of any semblance of any well-"Managed Business Assemblage": </p>
        <p> Your "Make-Bank Arsenal" of strategic divisions: </p>
        <p> Mergers & Business Acquisitions, Marketing Business Analytics, Monopolistic Buying Alliance </p>
        <p> Which must laboriously employ a continuous supply of these demanding human resources: 
        <p> Meticulous Bookworm Accountants, Maintenance-Busy Associates, Managing-Business Agents, Money-Bringing Affiliates! </p>
        <p> And make sure to strategically layoff the office high-performance-calorie cinnamon roles for this fiscal year's deadweight-loss. </p>
        <p> ******* </p>
        <p> ******* </p>
        <h1> Batter up!! Are you ready to give your greatest sales pitch?! </h1>
        <h1> Or will you strike out like the quashed proleteriat labor union? </h1>
        <h1> You can walk the walk with enough balls over home plate, but CAN YOU TALK THE TALK?! </h1>
        <h1> Let us CEO! Take a sip, take a shot, chase it with your dreams, and give it all ya got! </h1>        
        <p> Be sure to throw in some good ole' GMAT vocabulary for bonus brownie points! </p>
        <p> ******* </p>
        <p> Audience members: did you hear the perfect pitch?! </p>
        <p> Was it a F#, Eb, G natural, or the most amazingly innovative startup idea you've ever heard?  </p>
        <p> You know what they say, don't tell me what you think, show me what's in your portfolio! </p>
        <p> The patron of the arts decides who to defund! </p>
        <p> (Suggested: for a board of n players, each player distributes n tokens/shares/votes among everyone except themself.) </p>
        <p> The Corporate Committee of four furbies will then distribute the following n under n commendable prizes: </p>
        <p> "Most-Bought Asset" (MBA), bestowed upon the player with the most numeraire tokens, increasing the money supply causing inflation of egos." </p>
