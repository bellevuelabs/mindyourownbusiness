        <p> Mergers & Business Acquisitions, Marketing Business Analytics, Monopolistic Buying Alliance </p>
        <p> Which must laboriously employ a continuous supply of these demanding human resources: 
        <p> Meticulous Bookworm Accountants, Maintenance-Busy Associates, Managing-Business Agents, Money-Bringing Affiliates! </p>
